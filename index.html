            <h1><b>Welcome</b></h1>
            <p>Ok, I just heard a really funny baking story from my wife and so I just have to pass it along. I am sure that there are
            lots of other similar stories so please feel free to share yours.
            
            This happened to a friend of my wife (relayed by a mutual friend).
            
            Apparently, what happened is this... Her son was an Eagle Scout and all the parents of the Eagle Scouts were supposed to
            bring a cake for a cake decorating competition. Well, when she baked the cake, it fell and she didn't have time to bake
            another layer. She looked around for a solution and came up with what I guess could be called a creative one ... She
            stuffed the hole with paper towels and frosted over it. She decorated it elegantly with frosting and topped it off with
            a bouquet of flowers.
            
            Well, the big night came and the father and son went off to the scouting event with the cake leaving the mother at home.
            They won. Since they had won, they were asked to share their cake with the rest of the scouts and their fathers. You can
            guess what happened.
            
            When they came home, both father and son refused to talk to her for a month ! To this day, when it is her birthday,
            people from the area bring her a buckets of frosting along with roles of paper towels and ask her to bake them a cake. I
            suspect, she will never live it down.
            
            Ok, what's your humorous story? (If it actually happened to you, you get bonus points but it should at least have
            happened to someone you know.)
